# **FLOW DIGITAL CONVENTION FAMILY PHARMACIST FARMAFLUX FRONTEND**


-	From the pharmacy software, a link must be established to the PHM portal. On this PHM portal, two eForms will be available: one for vaccination and one for the “family pharmacist".
-	When the pharmacist navigates to the "family pharmacist" section, they will arrive at the mock-up page as shown in the ISV meeting. Here, digital signing can be activated by clicking the "Sign digitally" button in the signing block.

 

-	Next, the eID will be requested, and Nitro will automatically initiate the eID read-out. 
 - Technical info eid via nitro (integration will be done by Farmaflux – no actions from ISV demanded)

 - In the backend, Nitro will read the data from the eID and send it to Farmaflux. 
 - Farmaflux will then place the received information from the patient on the convention.
 - Farmaflux will also place the information from the CRM of the pharmacy and pharmacy holder onto the agreement. 
 - Farmaflux sends the completed agreement with all data fields filled back to Nitro. Nitro adds a timestamp and seal, and returns the document to Farmaflux.

-	Farmaflux will archive the signed document and make it available on the PCDH so that it can be consulted via the HUB - METAHUB by the patient and their healthcare providers with a therapeutic relationship. 



-	The document will also be downloadable from the “family pharmacist” page in the digital signing section.
 

-	Install of Nitro read-out software:

 - The first time Nitro initiates a digital read-out, the necessary program for Nitro’s read-out will be automatically installed if it is not already present. 
 - Farmaflux can also provide a button in the eForm that allows the pharmacist to install the program manually at a desired moment.
 - A third option, involving a push installation of the required software, was not retained by the software vendors.

-	In any case, the software vendors are not responsible for support regarding digital signing. This support will be provided by Farmaflux and Nitro.
