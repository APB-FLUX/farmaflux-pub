# PHM Portal - Vaccination
The PHM Portal (Population Health Management Portal) is a consolidated platform that supports pharmacists in managing health data and optimizing patient care by providing insights into the health of individual patients as well as pharmacy-level insights, allowing pharmacies to benchmark themselves at the meso and macro levels.

The government agreement describes the promotion of early detection and vaccination, assigning an important role to pharmacists. Through patient insights, the vaccination status of a patient can be visualized at any time, along with key points of attention for the pharmacist regarding vaccinations, thus helping to increase the overall vaccination rate.

The PHM Portal will initially consist of the Patient section, with a full focus on vaccination. The aim is to bring together and consolidate all vaccination-related data for a single patient for the pharmacist.
